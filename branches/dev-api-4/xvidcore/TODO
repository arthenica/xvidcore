TODO
====

This file lists the TODO items stll pending for the 1.0 release.


Active Items to work on:
------------------------

* update vfw & dshow decoder frontends
  - GUI isn't perfect for vfw and dshow still links against xvid.dll
    which doesn't export internal functions anymore because of the
    license change. 
* decide on vfw & dshow linking policy. presently we statically link,
    however this increases the size of zips/packages where both vfw &
    dshow are included.
* update/fix CBR plugin
  - misses target bitrate, bitrate burst in static motion/high motion
    transitions
* bug hunting (ed.gomez/sysKin)
  - xvidcore is still a place where bugs feel confortable
* docbook writing (every developer should contribute)
  - New API has to be documented.
* two pass code should not introduce quality regressions (every tester)
* YV12/I420/USER clarification
  - item submited by Ivan Kalvachev <ivan at cacad.com>
    Planes are swaped
* Interlacing is broken
  - item submited by Ivan Kalvachev <ivan at cacad.com>
    Artefacts for all interlaced blocks.
* MMX MPEG4 quantization is unprecise. This is probably an inherent
  problem in some MMX opcode precision.
