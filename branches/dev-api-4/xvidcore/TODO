TODO
====

This file lists the TODO items stll pending for the 1.0 release.


Active Items to work on:
------------------------

* update vfw & dshow decoder frontends
  - GUI isn't perfect for vfw and dshow still links against xvid.dll
    which doesn't export internal functions anymore because of the
    license change. 
* decide on vfw & dshow linking policy. presently we statically link,
    however this increases the size of zips/packages where both vfw &
    dshow are included.
* update/fix CBR plugin
  - misses target bitrate, bitrate burst in static motion/high motion
    transistions
* bug hunting (ed.gomez/sysKin)
  - xvidcore is still a place where bugs feel confortable
* quant matrix usage (not thread nor instance safe)
  - i (ed.gomez) started an API change to matrix related functions
    (quant_mpeg_xxx). But the remaining problem is that matrices should
    be put in FRAMEINFO structures, and matrices should be pushed down 
    through many function calls. I had no idea how to do that w/o
    hacking nastly.
* docbook writing (ed.gomez)
  - New API has to be documented.
* two pass code should not introduce quality regressions (every tester)
